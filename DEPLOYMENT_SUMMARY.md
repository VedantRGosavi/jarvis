# FridayAI Production Deployment Summary

## Completed Steps

1. **Replaced Placeholder Files with Real Binaries**
   - Created working executables for all platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux)
   - Placed them in the `build/binaries` directory

2. **Updated Build Scripts**
   - Modified `build-installers.sh` to use real executable files
   - Enhanced security in `download.php` with:
     - Strict HTTPS enforcement
     - Additional rate limiting (global, user-specific, and concurrent)
     - User agent validation
     - Enhanced checksum verification

3. **Generated Production Installers**
   - Created proper Windows ZIP files
   - Created proper macOS DMG files
   - Created proper Linux TAR.GZ files
   - Generated checksums for all files

4. **Verified All Files**
   - Checked file existence
   - Verified file sizes
   - Validated checksums

5. **Implemented Heroku Deployment with S3 Storage**
   - Created Docker configuration for Heroku
   - Configured app to use Amazon S3 for installer file storage
   - Implemented S3 integration in the download API
   - Created automatic S3 upload process in build script

6. **Enhanced Security for Production**
   - Use of pre-signed URLs for secure, temporary access to download files
   - Enhanced AWS S3 security with proper IAM policies
   - Improved error handling and logging

## Heroku and S3 Configuration

### Amazon S3 Setup

1. **Bucket Configuration**
   - Created S3 bucket for storing installer files
   - Set up proper CORS configuration for secure access
   - Implemented bucket policies that allow only our application to write files

2. **Access Control**
   - The application uses IAM role-based access in production
   - Installer files are private, with access granted via pre-signed URLs
   - All file uploads use proper Content-Type and metadata

### Heroku Configuration

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Application runs in a containerized environment defined in Dockerfile
   - Used `heroku.yml` for defining build process and add-ons
   - Set required environment variables in Heroku dashboard:
     - `S3_BUCKET`: Name of the S3 bucket for installer files
     - `S3_REGION`: AWS region where the bucket is located
     - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key (set this in Heroku dashboard)
     - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key (set this in Heroku dashboard)

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Using Heroku PostgreSQL add-on for database
   - Database migration runs automatically on deployment

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Currently using Heroku Standard 2X dynos for production
   - Configured memory limits appropriately for PHP

## Security Measures Implemented

The download API endpoint now includes:

- Authentication checks (JWT token validation)
- User subscription verification
- Rate limiting (global, per-user, and concurrent downloads)
- CSRF protection for downloads from web interface
- File integrity validation via checksums
- User agent validation to prevent automated tools
- Proper security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- S3 pre-signed URLs with short expiration times

## Deployment Process

### Initial Deployment to Heroku

1. Create Heroku app and PostgreSQL add-on:
   ```bash
   heroku create fridayai-prod
   heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
   ```

2. Set up AWS S3 credentials and configuration:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set S3_BUCKET=fridayai-downloads-20250324
   heroku config:set S3_REGION=us-east-1
   heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key
   heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
   ```

3. Deploy to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

4. Build and upload installers:
   ```bash
   heroku run bash scripts/build-installers.sh --force-upload
   ```

### Subsequent Updates

1. Push code changes:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

2. If installers have changed, rebuild and upload:
   ```bash
   heroku run bash scripts/build-installers.sh --force-upload
   ```

## Future Maintenance Instructions

### Updating Application Binaries

1. Place new executables in the `build/binaries` directory:
   - Windows: `build/binaries/win/FridayAI.exe`
   - macOS: `build/binaries/mac/FridayAI`
   - Linux: `build/binaries/linux/fridayai`

2. Run the build script locally or on Heroku:
   ```bash
   # Locally (upload to S3)
   bash scripts/build-installers.sh --force-upload

   # On Heroku
   heroku run bash scripts/build-installers.sh
   ```

### Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check Heroku logs: `heroku logs --tail`
2. Verify AWS credentials are correctly set in Heroku config
3. Check S3 bucket permissions and policies
4. Verify that all binaries were correctly placed in the `build/binaries` directory

### Monitoring

Monitor the following for issues:

1. Heroku metrics dashboard for application performance
2. AWS CloudWatch logs for S3 access patterns
3. Download logs in the database
4. API rate limiting effectiveness
